###Hello there, I am jLinda - Java Library for Interferometric Data Analysis. 

I'm older (and more mature) sister of [jDoris](https://github.com/ppolabs/jdoris)!

Keep an eye out for more functionality, announcements, and defenitely more comprehensive project readme - we'll be trickling them out over the next few weeks.
